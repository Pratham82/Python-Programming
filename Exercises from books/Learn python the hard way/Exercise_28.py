"""
In this exercise you will take the logic exercises you memorized and start trying them out in Python. Take
each of these logic problems and write what you think the answer will be. In each case it will be either
True or False. Once you have the answers written down, start Python in your Terminal and type each
logic problem in to confirm your answers.
