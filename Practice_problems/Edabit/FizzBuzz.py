# FizzBuzz Interview Question
# Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

# If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
# If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
# If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
# If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
# The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5.


def fizz_buzz(num):
	return "FizzBuzz" if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0 else "Fizz" if num % 3 == 0 else "Buzz" if num % 5 == 0 else str(num)

print(fizz_buzz(15))
print(fizz_buzz(5))
print(fizz_buzz(3))
print(type(fizz_buzz(98)))
